The only exit is the gargo hatch.

# How to open it?
It clearly misses some kind of a lever ^[ You can find the lever inside the cabinet ].

# I have the lever
Just insert it into the mechanic next to the hatch and pull the hatch open.

# It is jammed!
Oh, you should [grease it](020-unjam.md). Now you can pull the lever.

# Rats!
The fuse blew. [Fix it](030-fuse.md) to open the hatch.

# It is open
Freedom! Jump in there!

# Umm... no?
Right, you would need some kind of parachute.

# Parachute?
Take the tarp that is on top of the box.

# I have it
Note, you must first try to enter there _without_ the tarp. Then use the tarp on the hatch. Now you can exit.
